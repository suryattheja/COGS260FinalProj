This is consistent with atherosclerotic disease. In addition, marked prominence is noted to the pulmonary arteries in the perihilar location. Although the heart is not enlarged, this is concerning for concern for pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is calcified granuloma noted in the right lower lobe. Some interstitial prominence is noted at the left costophrenic XXXX greater than right. A subtle infiltrate cannot be excluded. The osseous structures are remarkable for degenerative changes.\u000a      \u000a
